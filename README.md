# OS-1000-lines-zig

## Project Overview
The OS-1000-lines-zig repository is a Zig-based operating system project. The primary purpose of this project is to create a simple, lightweight operating system with a focus on performance and scalability. The key features of this project include:

* A monolithic kernel architecture
* Support for basic process management and memory management
* A simple command-line interface

## Getting Started
To get started with the OS-1000-lines-zig project, you will need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

* Zig compiler (version 0.10.0 or later)
* A code editor or IDE of your choice
* A terminal or command prompt

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/botirk38/OS-1000-lines-zig.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command `cd OS-1000-lines-zig`
3. Build the project using the command `zig build`

## Usage
To use the OS-1000-lines-zig project, follow these steps:

1. Run the project using the command `zig run`
2. Interact with the command-line interface to execute commands and view output

Some basic examples of usage include:

* Running a simple "Hello World" program
* Viewing system information such as memory usage and process list

## Architecture Overview
The OS-1000-lines-zig project uses a monolithic kernel architecture, which means that the kernel and user space are combined into a single executable. The kernel is responsible for managing processes, memory, and other system resources.

The project includes several key components, including:

* `src/kernel.zig`: The kernel implementation, which provides basic process management and memory management functionality.
* `src/common.zig`: A utility file that provides common functions and macros used throughout the project.
* `build.zig`: The build script, which is used to compile and link the project.

## Configuration
The project uses a simple configuration file to store settings and options. To modify the configuration, edit the `config.zig` file and rebuild the project.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! To contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

## License
The OS-1000-lines-zig project is licensed under the MIT License. See the `LICENSE` file for more information.

## Testing and Validation
The project includes automated tests and validation scripts to ensure its correctness and stability. To run the tests, use the command `zig test`.

## Future Development
There are several areas for future development and expansion of the operating system, including:

* Adding support for more advanced process management and memory management features
* Implementing a more robust command-line interface
* Adding support for networking and file systems
